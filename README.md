# JRubyArt Book
There is a need for book on JRubyArt, it might get written here.

Vanilla processing [supported platforms](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Supported-Platforms) should be able to run JRubyArt, requires a jdk8 install and some form of ruby-2.3 (preferably JRuby-9.1.13.0). Unless you have installed JRuby yourself you will need to install JRuby-Complete

`k9 --install`.
